# Dotfiles ðŸŽ‰

My very own dotfile repo for keeping track of configs across systems. I try to keep the OS specific settings seperate.

## Installation
_Disclaimer: You probably shouldn't. These config files contain lots of settings that will only work on my machine. They are meant to replace the ones already on your computer, so your things will probably break. Please use the files for for inspiration, and if you want to create your own dotfile repo, you should read [this](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/)._

1. The dotfiles will be placed relative to `~/`, so make sure you are logged in with the right user, or change the `clean` value in the `install-[OS].conf.yaml` file.
2. Clone this repo to a place where you want to keep it permanently. A symlink to the folder will be placed at `~/.dotfiles`.
3. Run `./install-[OS]`

### Sublime Text 3
To install the config files for Sublime Text 3, a few additional steps is required.

1. Install Sublime Text 3
2. Remove the `User` folder (Located at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` on macOS).
3. Run `./install-[OS]`
4. Make sure [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) is installed
