# Dotfiles

My own dotfile repo for keeping track of configs across systems. I try to keep the OS specific settings seperate, while sharing what's possible. I wouldn't recommend 

I use [Dotbot](https://git.io/dotbot) to handle installation.

## Installation
First, clone this repo to a place where you want to keep it permanently. A symlink to the folder will be placed at `~/.dotfiles`.


### MacOS

```
./install-macos
```

### Linux
```
./install-linux
```
