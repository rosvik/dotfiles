  When running or updating this script, keep in mind:
  - It is safe to run several times.
  - It does not require dotfiles to be installed, but some of the software
    requires setup from dotfiles to work properly.

  Some version managers are installed instead of specific languages:
  - node:    ${YELLOW}nvm install --lts && nvm use --lts${RESET}
  - python:  ${YELLOW}pyenv install 3.9 && pyenv global 3.9${RESET}
  - ruby:    ${YELLOW}rbenv install 2.7.6 && rbenv global 2.7.6${RESET}
