  ${HEADER}Install script for MacOS software ‚ú®${RESET}
  ${UNDERLINE}https://github.com/rosvik/dotfiles${RESET}

  When running or updating this script, keep in mind:
  - It is safe to run several times, but some upgrades may happen when doing so.
  - It does not require dotfiles to be installed, but some of the software
    requires setup from dotfiles to work properly.

  Some version managers are installed instead of specific languages:
  - node:    ${YELLOW}fnm install --lts && fnm use 22${RESET}
  - python:  ${YELLOW}pyenv install 3.9 && pyenv global 3.9${RESET}
  - ruby:    ${YELLOW}rbenv install 2.7.6 && rbenv global 2.7.6${RESET}
  - java:    ${YELLOW}sdk install java 21.0.2-open${RESET}
